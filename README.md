# hello-world
My first repository.
I  don't know what I'm doing!
Just want to make one of my mechanical keyboards bluetooth using a nice!nano mcu.
Funny thing is I've worked for an IT company in the R&D department for over 5 years - writing end-user documentation and producing how-to videos. But, this side of the dev world is completely new to me. It is good that I've been involved in dev projects though because I recognise a lot of the terms that I'm seeing on the GitHub Docs, e.g. Commits, Branches, Pull Request, etc.
